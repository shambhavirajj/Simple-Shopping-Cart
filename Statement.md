# Problem Statement
The Simple Shopping Cart System is a Python-based program designed to simulate a shopping experience. It allows users to add items with prices to a virtual cart, view the contents of the cart, remove items, and checkout by calculating the total amount. This project demonstrates practical application of programming concepts such as functions, lists, loops, conditional statements, and input/output handling.

# Scope of the Project
This project provides a basic simulation of a shopping cart system, making it easy for users to manage their purchases. It can be used as a learning tool for beginners to understand modular programming and logical workflow in Python. The system can be further enhanced in the future to include features like quantity management, database storage, discounts, and online payment simulation.

# Target Users
- Students learning Python programming
- Beginners interested in understanding modular program design
- Anyone who wants to simulate a simple shopping cart experience

# High-Level Features
1. *Add Item Module*: Users can add items along with their price to the shopping cart.  
2. *View Cart Module*: Users can view all items currently in the cart along with the total price.  
3. *Remove Item Module*: Users can remove any item from the cart based on its index.  
4. *Checkout Module*: Users can finalize their purchases and see the total amount.  
5. *Exit Option*: Users can exit the program at any time.
